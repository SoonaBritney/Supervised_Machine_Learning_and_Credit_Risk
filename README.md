## Deliverable 4: Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (30 points)

- Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
- Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
